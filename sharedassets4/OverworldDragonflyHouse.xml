    <line>The truck pulls up to a house with an intensely bright porchlight. A cloud of dragonflies swells around the light: darting, hovering, turning at right angles.</line>

    <line>There are no lights on in the house. A stencil on the mailbox reads: &quot;2880 Beaker Blvd.&quot; And below, written in marker: &quot;NO SOLICITORS. I WORK FOR LONG HOURS AND RETIRE EARLY.&quot;</line>
